WikiWalker is a screensaver that wanders through Wikipedia with a zoom/fade effect.  It starts on the Life (disambiguation) page, and picks random links on each page to follow.  If you're lucky it might head towards the Meaning of life page, and then, who knows...

I have added some code insipired by Ben Gottlieb's WikiPath (his winning entry to the Iron Coder contest), specifically:
* the TestHarness
* using javascript to get the list of links from the webview
