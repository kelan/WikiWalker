Did this revision:
* added notes.txt and Release Notes.txt files to both TM and Xcode project
* Added a check in webViewDidFinishLoading: to make sure it is the correct webview posting the notifications
	* there can be multiple in 1 process if there is 2 screens, or by pressing "Test" in System Prefs (while the preview is running).  This is what was causing LOTS of my crashes before.
* Made the scrolling text a bit smaller
