TODO:

* why does the test harness think the saverView isa NSView (and not my WWsaver class)?
	* maybe ask ben this.  Is this why he manually inited the view, instead of doing it in IB?
	
* I made listOfWikiLinks hold dictionaries that have "url" and "index" keys.  So, later, when following a link, I can hopefully gets its locaiton on the page by using javascript and that link number

* check all deallocs for proper memory managament
* remove all nextImage and nextPageTitle and nextURL stuff
* make sure the rect sizes are set correctly
* figure out what to do in startAnimation and stopAnimation
* try to use JS to get coordinates of link on screen (Jonathan Wight's suggetion)
	* look at: http://blog.firetree.net/2005/07/04/javascript-find-position/
	* grab all links with JS, and remeber the link #
* change name of WikiWalkerView to WWScreenSaverView (?)
* make stopAnimation do something (?)

Javascript to find object location on page:
* from: http://blog.firetree.net/2005/07/04/javascript-find-position/

function findPosX(obj)
{
  var curleft = 0;
  if(obj.offsetParent)
      while(1) 
      {
        curleft += obj.offsetLeft;
        if(!obj.offsetParent)
          break;
        obj = obj.offsetParent;
      }
  else if(obj.x)
      curleft += obj.x;
  return curleft;
}

function findPosY(obj)
{
  var curtop = 0;
  if(obj.offsetParent)
      while(1)
      {
        curtop += obj.offsetTop;
        if(!obj.offsetParent)
          break;
        obj = obj.offsetParent;
      }
  else if(obj.y)
      curtop += obj.y;
  return curtop;
}

Did this revision:
* changed to use WebView FrameLoadDelegate method webView:didFinishLoadForFrame: instead of the Notification
* changed WWOffsceenWebiView to have a "client" and call imageIsReady on that client when the image is ready, instead of using a Notification
* added TestHarness Target (to help debugging), HarnessController.[hm], TestHarness.nib
	* copied from Ben's WikiPath (thanks Ben!)
* started to prepare code to send to Sonos
