Did this revision:
* make everything work and cleaned up extra NSLogs and notes
* replaced the JavaScript with one that searches via urls, instead of link #
* changed the flow of updating the new page so that its simpler and more reliable
* added the javascript function to get the height of the next link in the new page
* made the zoom focus on the height of the new link
* renamed WikiWalkerView to WWScreenSaverView
* took out a lot of extra comments and non-working code, so it looks nice for Sonos
* finished WWOfflineImageSource for when we can't connect to the internet
* changed all header comments
